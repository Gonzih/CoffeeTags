# CoffeeTags

A tiny, simple tool for generating tags (Ctags compatible ) for use with Vim + [TagBar plugin](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar)

It might work with other plugins/editors which can use Ctags (such as Emacs or
TagList for Vim).


# Installation

`gem install CoffeeTags` (when it's released :-))

# TODO

- squash all bugs
